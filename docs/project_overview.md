# Daily Infrastructure Report Project: Overview and Scope

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the scope and objectives of the Daily Infrastructure Report Project. The primary goal of this project is to automate the collection of critical infrastructure metrics, generate comprehensive daily reports in PDF or Excel format, and distribute these reports to the system administration team. This automation aims to enhance operational efficiency, provide timely insights into system health, and facilitate proactive maintenance and troubleshooting.

## 2. Project Objectives

The key objectives of this project are as follows:

*   **Automated Data Collection:** Implement robust scripts to automatically gather data on:
    *   Number of running servers.
    *   Disk usage per host.
    *   User logins from `/var/log/secure`.
    *   System uptime.

*   **Report Generation:** Develop a system capable of generating daily reports in both PDF and Excel formats, summarizing the collected infrastructure data.

*   **Automated Distribution:** Establish a mechanism to automatically email the generated reports to a designated system administration group every morning.

*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Provide detailed documentation covering the system architecture, data flow, implementation details, and operational procedures.

## 3. Scope of Work

This project encompasses the following key areas:

### 3.1. Data Collection Module

This module will be responsible for:

*   Developing individual scripts for each data point (running servers, disk usage, user logins, system uptime).
*   Ensuring the scripts are secure, efficient, and capable of handling potential errors during data retrieval.
*   Storing collected data temporarily for report generation.

### 3.2. Report Generation Module

This module will focus on:

*   Designing report templates for both PDF and Excel formats.
*   Implementing logic to populate the templates with collected data.
*   Ensuring reports are clear, concise, and easy to interpret.

### 3.3. Email Notification Module

This module will cover:

*   Configuring email sending capabilities within the system.
*   Crafting informative email content to accompany the reports.
*   Managing recipient lists for report distribution.

### 3.4. Automation and Scheduling

This aspect of the project will involve:

*   Setting up a reliable scheduling mechanism (e.g., cron jobs) to trigger daily data collection and report generation.
*   Ensuring proper permissions and execution environment for automated tasks.

### 3.5. Documentation

Comprehensive documentation will be provided, including:

*   System architecture diagrams.
*   Data flow diagrams.
*   Installation and configuration guides.
*   Troubleshooting procedures.
*   User manual for accessing and interpreting reports.

## 4. Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly out of scope for this project:

*   Real-time monitoring and alerting (this project focuses on daily reporting).
*   Integration with third-party monitoring tools beyond basic data collection.
*   Advanced data analytics or predictive modeling.
*   User interface for report customization (reports will be generated based on predefined templates).

## 5. Stakeholders

The primary stakeholders for this project include:

*   **System Administration Team:** Recipients of the daily reports, key users of the system.
*   **IT Operations Management:** Oversees infrastructure health and relies on these reports for decision-making.
*   **Project Sponsor:** Provides overall guidance and resources for the project.

## 6. Success Criteria

The success of this project will be measured by:

*   Successful daily generation and delivery of accurate reports.
*   Reliability and stability of data collection scripts.
*   Positive feedback from the system administration team regarding report utility and clarity.
*   Completeness and usability of project documentation.

## 7. Conclusion

This project aims to deliver a robust and automated solution for daily infrastructure reporting, significantly improving visibility into system health and streamlining operational workflows. By adhering to the defined scope and objectives, we anticipate a successful implementation that provides tangible benefits to the organization.
